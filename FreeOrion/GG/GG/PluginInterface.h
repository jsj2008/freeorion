/** \brief The interface to custom-control plugins.

    This class is used to access derived GG controls and dialogs that are
    unknown until runtime, but are available for dynamic loading in shared
    libraries/DLLs.  The interface basically allows you to create custom
    controls and dialogs (anything a StyleFactory can produce) from a
    dynamic-link library, which in turn allows you to change the styles of the
    controls in an application without recompiling, or even relinking.  While
    the interface is in an unloaded state, the functions in the interface are
    all null, and calling any of them will crash your app.  Once a plugin has
    been loaded, all the functions in the interface should be valid (if the
    plugin author did everything correctly).  The plugin interface also
    provides SaveWnd() and LoadWnd() methods to serialize all types in the
    GG::Wnd hierarchy.  Note that includes all the original GG types, not just
    the ones added by the plugin; if Wnd is not serializable, none of its
    descendents are either. */

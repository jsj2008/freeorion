Description:  
        Wrappers for the "ScriptingBrige" framework on MacOSX 10.5 or later. This 
        framework provides an easy way to use the scripting functionality of 
        applications ("AppleScript") from Cocoa applications.
        
        The functionality of this framework is comparable to that off "appscript",
        although the latter is better tuned for use in Python applications and is
        available on MacOSX 10.4 as well.
        
        These wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention
        for information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation
        for general tips and tricks regarding the translation between Python
        and (Objective-)C frameworks
        
Platform: MacOS X

Description:  
        Wrappers for the "Quartz" related frameworks on MacOSX. These frameworks
        provide a number of graphics related API's.
        
        The frameworks wrapped by this package are:
        
           * CoreGraphics - 2D Graphics, based on the PDF model
        
           * ImageIO - Reading and writing images
        
           * QuartzComposer - Working with "Quartz Composer" compositions
        
           * QuartzCore  - Image processing and video image manipulation
        
           * QuarzFilters - Image effects
        
           * ImageKit - iPhoto-like views
        
           * PDFKit - Working with PDF files
        
           * CoreVideo - Managing digital video
        
        All frameworks can be accessed by importing the 'Quartz' module.
        
        These wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention
        for information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation
        for general tips and tricks regarding the translation between Python
        and (Objective-)C frameworks
        
        NOTE: The actual wrappers are subpackages of ``Quartz``, they are not toplevel
        packages to avoid name clashes with Apple provided wrappers for CoreGraphics.
        
        WARNING: Running the unittests will change your display settings during the
        testrun, which will probably mess up your window layout.

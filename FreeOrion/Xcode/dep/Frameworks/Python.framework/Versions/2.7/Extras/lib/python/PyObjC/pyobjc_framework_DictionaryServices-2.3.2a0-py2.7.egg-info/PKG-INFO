Description:  
        Wrappers for the "DictionaryServices" framework on MacOSX 10.5 or later. 
        
        Dictionary Services lets you create your own custom dictionaries that users 
        can access through the Dictionary application. You also use these services to 
        access dictionaries programatically and to support user access to dictionary 
        look-up through a contextual menu.
        
        These wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention
        for information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation
        for general tips and tricks regarding the translation between Python
        and (Objective-)C frameworks
